# How to use git

### GIT - The easiest method (in a summary)

1. Create a repo on GitHub
2. Clone that remote repo on local PC
3. Write/code whatever in that folder (repo you cloned)
4. Push to remote repo

### Details

##### Step 1 (Basic Setup)
* Create a GitHub account
* Create new repository
* public/private (whatever you want)
* add readme (if you want)
* Click on Create repository

Now your repo is created

#### Step 2 (Cloning)

* go inside your repo and click on the green button (with a download kind of sign and code written on it)
* that will create a link, copy that link
* open your folder where you want to keep this folder(repo)
* right click --> open git bash
* ```git clone "theLinkYouCopied"```

###### Like for example--
```git clone "https://www.github.com/username/repo"```
###### (Link must be in quotes)
###### Now cloned, and since you cloned from GitHub, git is already initialised in this repo.

#### Step 3 (The Coding Part)

###### (that you do yourself, the productivity part) The usual coding, problem-solving stuff

#### Step 4 (Pushing to remote repository)

And now whenever you feel like, code is complete, or maybe a part of it is complete, you confirm the changes,
but before this you need to confirm your identity

```git config user.name "yourGithubUsername"```
```git config user.email "yourEmail```
######(Whatever is in quotes must be in quotes)
You can also configure this globally

Then you add the changes by

```git add fileThatChanged```
######(file name with extension without quotes)

###### Example - if I have a file named test.cpp and I want to add this file, then I would write
```git add test.cpp```

Or if you want to add all changed files, just write

```git add .```
###### (that (.) dot is important, meaning everything in this folder)

Now you need to commit to the changes.
###### (Commit is same as commitment as in English language) meaning to finalise the decision.

```git commit -m "commit message"```

-m for message, and commit message in quotes,
###### This message should be short, compact but convey the changes you did.
###### It is a general practice to write commit messages in present tense.

Ok, now the changes are finalised, you need to push this to your remote repo, Just write

```git push```
###### (In case of single branch repository)

Else, you need to write 
```git push origin branchName```
###### (branchName specifies the branch you want to commit to)


##### This will ask to confirm your identity, it will open your GitHub with an oAuth request, just give your GitHub credentials there.

##### Once authenticated, changes will be pushed to your remote origin (GitHub)

|```git status``` | to check the status of your repository|
|```git log``` | to see all commits |
| ```git diff``` | to show the changes in files line by line |
| ```git checkout commitID``` | to roll back (revert back) to a previous commit (commit ID is a unique ID given to each commit you make, can be seen in git log) |
| ```git checkout -b branchName``` | to go the existing branch, if it exists. Else, it creates a new branch with that given name |
| ```git branch``` | shows all the branches in your repository |
